# bandcamp-scraper
Simple *nix CLI python scraper for Bandcamp release pages, outputting a CSV with the track titles and times.

This script requires that your python distribution have lxml and pandas. These can be installed via pip.

To run, input:

python /path/to/script

For the first prompt, paste in the Bandcamp release page.

For the second, type a path for your CSV. You'll need to make sure to end it with .csv
